### ü§ù $5,000 Best Public Good with Account Abstraction or Gasless transactions on Polygon

Mastaa is a project around a modular paymaster.

The basic principle is to allow a decentralized application (any application) to deploy a paymaster, which will allow it to sponsor the transaction fees of a part of its users, for example for new users.

The way it works is quite simple: the deployed contract is a proxy (more details in "how it's made"), which uses a module to match the "paymaster" qualification. It is completely customizable, and the solution we propose allows teams to implement other modules (or remove existing ones).

We tried to kept the UI pretty simple to allow developers to deploy quickly.
